# Job Search Tool (React Native + JSearch)

This tool helps prospective developers find jobs suitable for their skillset :)

This was a fun challenge to make, and a bonus was that I was able to learn React Native along the way.

## Usage
1. Download Expo Go on mobile
2. Navigate to the following link: https://expo.dev/@murphylee10/job-finder?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go
3. Scan the QR Code and open the link in Expo Go
